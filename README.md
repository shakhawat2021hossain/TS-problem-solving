# How TypeScript Improves Code Quality and Project Maintainability

TypeScript enhances code quality and maintainability by providing the following benefits:

**Static Type Checking**
It catches errors before the code runs, making the code more stable and reducing bugs.

**Better Readability**
Type annotations make the code easier to understand, helping developers know what data types are being used.

**Better Developer Tools**
TypeScript works well with IDEs, offering features like auto-completion and error checking, which speeds up development.

**Easier Refactoring**
When changing code, TypeScript ensures that nothing breaks, making it safer to modify the code.

**Encourages Best Practices**
It supports good coding practices like object-oriented and functional programming, improving the structure of the code.

By using TypeScript, you get a more reliable, readable, and maintainable codebase, making it easier to scale and work on long-term projects.


# Use of Enums in TypeScript

Enums in TypeScript are used to define a set of named constants, improving code readability and maintainability. There are two types:
1. Numeric Enums: Each member has a numeric value.
2. String Enums: Each member has a string value.

```bash
enum Status {
  Active = "ACTIVE",
  Inactive = "INACTIVE",
  Pending = "PENDING"
}

let currentStatus: Status = Status.Active;
console.log(currentStatus);  // Output: "ACTIVE"
```

```bash
enum Status {
  Active = "ACTIVE",
  Inactive = "INACTIVE",
  Pending = "PENDING"
}

let currentStatus: Status = Status.Active;
console.log(currentStatus);  // Output: "ACTIVE"
